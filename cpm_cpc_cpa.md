## CPM
- The advantage of CPM is that at first sight it’s cheaper. 
- The disadvange is that an “impression” is not the same as a visit or action. Lots of people can actually view the ads but this doesn’t mean the campaign will bring about tangible results.
- The better the segmentation (specs of the target audience) and the more attractive the ad, the more effective the CPM campaigns.

## CPC
- The advantage of CPC campaigns is the fact that you only pay for impressions that have generated interest enough so as to follow the link. 
- Its disadvantage is basically the same as before –a click does not translate into a specific action. The user might simply get into the site and leave immediately afterwards, making no purchase or sharing no personal data at all.

## CPM
- The advantage of CPA is that you pay only if you get some profit. 
- The disadvantage is that the cost per action on these type of campaigns may be higher than the cost of well-designed CPM or CPC campaigns.
    - For example, a very effective CPM campaign could cost $400 and get 1000 finished actions, with a cost per action of $0.4. In the meantime, a CPA campaign could cost us that same $400 with only half the finished actions.

## [Does them matters](https://www.k6agency.com/cpc-cpm-cpa-cpl/)
#### Does CPC matter?
- CPC matters if you know your metrics to be profitable. Depending on your goal, some companies want to have the most visibility while others want to get sales fast. We believe both goals are important. **A large brand might benefit more long term from visibility while smaller brands need to get profits in order to keep going**.
- For example, CPC might be a good metric for a large brand promoting to new audiences while a small brand might benefit from knowing what a click means in terms of profits.
- For example, if they know that on 100 website visitors, 4 convert into customers and that each customer brings on average $40 of profits, then every click would be worth 4 times $40 divided by 100 which is $1.6. In this example, you would want to aim for clicks below to $1.6 to make profits.
- **Why would you choose CPC instead of metrics such as ROI?** Well, you might not spend enough on an ad set to generate enough results in order to optimize. By having CPC, you’ll get enough results for Facebook to optimize your budget.

#### Does CPM matter?
- CPM matters if you know your metrics to be profitable again. It’s a good metric if your only goal is to have your ad seen as many times as possible, but if your goal is profit, it might not be the right objective.
- **It could be a good objective if you know your metrics**, such as CTR, which stands for click-through rate. It’s the number of people who click on your ad to see your website divided by the number of times your ad has been seen.
- If you know what a click is worth to you, then you could find your profits based on the CPM.
- For example, if a click is worth $1.6, meaning a click brings you $1.6 every time, and your CTR is 5%, this would mean that 1,000 impressions bring 50 clicks which is $80. Now you would be able to know that a CPM below $80 brings you profit.
- The hard part here is that metrics like these on low ad spends vary a lot, big budgets tend to bring more stable metrics. This means you should use this metric only if you spend a large Facebook ad budget in our opinion or if your goal is to just get visibility but not track direct profit returns.

#### Does CPA matter?
- CPA matters if you want to make profits. Although a lot of companies use CPA as “cost per action”, this action is most often acquisition. It’s the cost you pay for every customer.
- **If you know how much a customer is worth to you**, then you can easily calculate if your advertising spends is profitable for you. It’s actually quite easy.
- This metric is often one of the most important ones in digital advertising, especially small companies trying to scale.
