### Facebook Pixel
When someone **visits your website and takes an action** (for example, view content, add to cart, add to wishlist, initiate checkout, add payment, purchase, complete registration, lead), the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action. This way, you'll know when a customer took an action after seeing your Facebook ad. You'll also be able to reach this customer again by using a **custom audience**（advertiser have run and using a list uploaded to Facebook containing the information, especially an email and phone number, facebook matched the uploaded information to the profile, without revealing user's identity to the advertiser）. When more and more conversions happen on your website, Facebook gets better at delivering your ads to people who are more likely to take certain actions. This is called conversion optimization.
